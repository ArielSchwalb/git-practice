            <h4> 1. Jump in with Break Into Tech </h4>
            <p>You will be amazed by how quickly you will pick up basic coding <br>
                concepts through Skillcrush's fantastic Break Into Tech program.<br> 
                It is designed for beginners, so even if you have never written <br>
                a line of code before, you will find yourself writing code almost<br>
                immediately. It may be hard to believe, but it is true! 
            </p>
            <h4> 2. Take Advantage of Every Opportunity </h4>
            <p> Skillcrush provides ample opportunities to build projects, such as <br>
                calculators, games, and more! While these may seem difficult<br>
                and silly at first, stay open-minded. It is actally these kinds of<br>
                coding projects which will allow you to practice your skills and build <br>
                up your portfolio. When you talk to future employers or even academic <br>
                admissions counselors, you will want to show them the projects that<br>
                 you worked on while learning to code.
            </p>

           <h4> 3. Be a Nerd </h4>
           <p> Let your inner nerd shine. Don't be afraid to get excited about quirky<br>
               coding things. Become a hungry "bookworm," absorb as much information <br>
               as you can about the subject you want to learn. And remember, there are <br>
               no stupid questions! Just like everyone first learns to walk by taking <br>
               baby steps, every programmer learns to code by learning their new skills<br>
                bit by bit. So go for it and don't look back.
