                <h4> 1. Jump in with Break Into Tech </h4>
                <p>You will be amazed by how quickly you will pick up basic coding <br>
                    concepts through Skillcrush's fantastic Break Into Tech program.<br> 
                    It is designed for beginners, so even if you have never written <br>
                    a line of code before, you will find yourself writing code almost<br>
                    immediately. It may be hard to believe, but it is true! 
                </p>

                <h4> 2. Take Advantage of Every Opportunity </h4>
                <p> Skillcrush provides ample opportunities to build projects, such as <br>
                    calculators, games, and more! While these may seem difficult<br>
                    and silly at first, stay open-minded. It is actally these kinds of<br>
                    coding projects which will allow you to practice your skills and build <br>
                    up your portfolio. When you talk to future employers or even academic <br>
                    admissions counselors, you will want to show them the projects that<br>
                     you worked on while learning to code.
                </p>
                
               <h4> 3. Be a Nerd </h4>
               <p> Let your inner nerd shine. Don't be afraid to get excited about quirky<br>
                   coding things. Become a hungry "bookworm," absorb as much information <br>
                   as you can about the subject you want to learn. And remember, there are <br>
                   no stupid questions! Just like everyone first learns to walk by taking <br>
                   baby steps, every programmer learns to code by learning their new skills<br>
                    bit by bit. So go for it and don't look back.

                <h4>Don't fear the unknown!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first website or app, it feels like you are in a dark cave feeling around for the walls. You aren't sure exactly where you are going, and that can be scary. But have no fear! The light will shine at the end of the tunnnel.</p>

                <p>You will be exposed to new technologies and software systems. You will try and fail and try again and eventually you will master it.</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                    language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                    the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
                </p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part
                    of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning
                    to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
                    totally understand what it's doing.</p>
